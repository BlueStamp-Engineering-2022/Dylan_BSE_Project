# Biometrics Sensor
# Final Milestone
This is my Final milestone and it is designing my case in fusion360 to 3d print it and an extension for my button as it wasn’t long enough. I learned how to use fusion360 software, and the functions inside of it like constraints and filets. Some things I enjoyed throughout my project was seeing what I designed in CAD actually function and work as a case, and the brainstorming part of my design like figuring out all the right dimensions and spacings between the parts using a caliper, and mechanical drawings. I struggled with figuring out how to make an extension for my button because my original design for my case was too big for my button and figuring out how to strengthen the legs in my case that held up my pcb because the legs that supported it were too thin and broke. My next steps are to design a case in cad for my battery pack, and adding in a speaker to beep whenever the sensor was done measuring someone’s heart rate.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is being able to hook up all my parts to my pcb including the OLED display, a heart rate and blood oxygen sensor, and an Arduino Nano. I enjoyed seeing my project finally work after so many tries and being able to see my health biometrics. Some things I struggled with figuring out how to use my sensor, soldering parts on, and adjusting my code for it to be able to work on my project.

# Starter Project
 My starter project was TV-B-Gone. The purpose of TV-B-Gone is to be able to shut off any tv in a public place. I was able to learn how all the parts in my project worked, like what transistors and capacitors did. I really enjoyed soldering all the parts in and seeing my project work on a real tv. One thing I really struggled with is desoldering my resistor when I soldered it in the wrong hole on my PCB.
