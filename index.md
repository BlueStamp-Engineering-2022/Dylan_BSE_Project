# Biometrics Display
 My starter project was TV-B-Gone. The purpose of TV-B-Gone is to be able to shut off any tv in a public place. I was able to learn how all the parts in my project worked, like what transistors and capacitors did. I really enjoyed soldering all the parts in and seeing my project work on a real tv. One thing I really struggled with is desoldering my resistor when I soldered it in the wrong hole on my PCB.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is being able to hook up all my parts to my pcb including the OLED display, a heart rate and blood oxygen sensor, and an Arduino Nano. I enjoyed seeing my project finally work after so many tries and being able to see my health biometrics. Some things I struggled with figuring out how to use my sensor, soldering parts on, and adjusting my code for it to be able to work on my project.
